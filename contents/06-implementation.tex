\section{Background Replacement}
\label{sec:implementation-bgreplace}

For our purposes, we are just interested in the actual user facing the drone, which is the person closest to the camera, thus usually the biggest one among all the people found by Mask R-CNN. Bounding boxes (not shown in the picture) and labels associated with each object instance are used to identify the correct mask (i.e., the one corresponding to the user), which is later used during training.
