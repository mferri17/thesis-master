Here a bunch of other images not inserted in the main chapters, in order to keep some section shorter and enhance general readability. Following figures are not crucial for the understanding of our work, but they add minor details.




\section{FrontalNet}

Please note that following architecture is for classification purposes presented in section \ref{subsec:gradcam-regrtoclass}. Standard model outputs have shapes \texttt{(?, 1)} instead.

Figure \ref{fig:frontalnet-trajectories}, taken from \cite{mantegazza2019visionbased}, presents trajectories followed by the drone during five consecutive trials in the drone arena. The quadrotor has to face a user initially rotated by 90 degrees. Although the paths (obtained two distinct models A1 and A2) are sometimes different from what designed by the omniscient controller (the ground truth), they are still reasonable, and flying capabilities inside the drone arena seem very promising.

\section{Grad-CAM}
\label{sec:extra-gradcam}

This sections reports \gls{gradcam} applications appropriately divided into variables and classes, in contrast with the single-image approach followed in section \ref{subsec:gradcam-results}.
