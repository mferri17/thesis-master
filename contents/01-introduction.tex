\section{Objective}
\label{sec:objective}

Autonomous navigation is an important and well-known research area in robotics, which usually requires accomplishing complex and computationally-expensive tasks such as localization, mapping, and path planning. Recent studies have started to approach autonomous driving through imitation learning \cite{imitation_learning_survey}. The approach consist in making a neural network learn its task by imitating human or robot behaviors.
